# User Story: Brick Breaker Game

If I were a user I would want to:

Have a great user interface.

    be able to see my game board

    I want the arrows to control my paddle for the bricks breaker game

    have bricks disapear as they are hit. 

    if won, have a screen effect that excites me?


Have a game be responsive.

    being able to switch between keys quickly.

if I am going to pe playing a game I want it to be easily understandable.
    probably have a "how to play" button that tells me how to play the game. 


I would want some sort of reward while playing the game. 

    having things like power ups or something to help finish the game faster

If possible add a difficulties 

    adding some obstruction randomly throughout the game

    like adding a bar that pops up randomly to have the player <br> suffer a little in a harder difficluty

    maybe have some bricks that instead of dying immediatly they take <br> a few hits and change color when hit to show <br> that it needs to be hit more.
